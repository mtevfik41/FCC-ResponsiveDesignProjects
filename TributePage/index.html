            Ali Kemal Sunal (10 November 1944 – 3 July 2000) was a Turkish
            actor. With Hababam Sınıfı, Kapıcılar Kralı and Davaro, Sunal gained
            large popularity amongst Turkish cinema goers and was famed for his
            character "Şaban", a role he frequently played.

          <h3>Career</h3>
          <p>
            Kemal Sunal graduated from Vefa Lisesi (Vefa High School). In his
            early ages, he started pursuing what was to become a long and
            successful acting career in minor roles in various theatres. For a
            brief period, he worked in the Kenterler Theatre and debuted in the
            play Zoraki Tabip. He was later transferred to the Devekuşu Kabare
            Theatre, where he performed his acting.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            He was recognized as a real talent, and started receiving offers for
            movies with larger budgets and a more famous cast. His first bigger
            role was in the film "Tatlı Dillim" directed by Ertem Eğilmez. In a
            matter of years, Sunal co-starred alongside Halit Akçatepe, Şener
            Şen and Münir Özkul.

        </li>

            Perhaps the most famous of all his parts was when he played in
            Hababam Sınıfı (The Outrageous Class) and was known by the name of
            "Şaban", but most of his classmates just called him İnek (cow)
            Şaban. İnek Şaban was constantly bullied and humiliated by his
            friends, but this never kept him from thinking the unthinkable, like
            digging a tunnel to escape school grounds (which later, turned out
            to lead to the vice-principal’s office) or smoking in the school
            attic. The character was so pure and so fixed in the memories of the
            Turkish people, it was never replaced by another actor in the recent
            re-shootings of Hababam Sınıfı, most probably as a sign of respect
            to Sunal.

            His other notable characters include: Tosun Pasha; Süt Kardeş Şaban;
            Çöpçüler Kralı, who fell in love with a municipality officer’s
            fiancée; Doktor Civanım, a former hospital janitor pretending to be
            a doctor upon his return to his home village; and finally "Orta
            Direk Şaban", a naive man trying to become an athlete to impress his
            crush.

            The huge popularity of his movies stemmed not only from their unique
            humour but also their depiction of the many problems faced by the
            poor rural people in Turkey during the 1970s and 1980s. In almost
            all of his films, Kemal Sunal plays a poor man, trying to make a
            living.

            Sunal’s last film was Propaganda, which was directed by Sinan Çetin.
            Sunal, played a customs officer-in-charge (presumably) on the Syrian
            border. Being a serious drama, this film was a contrast to his other
            works. As the plot unfolded, Sunal’s character fell into despair,
            trying to survive the dilemma between his duties as an officer of
            the law and his duties as a friend. In the public opinion, this film
            was not the best of his works. Another significant fact about this
            film is that it also included Ali Sunal, Kemal Sunal’s son, cast as
            a junior customs officer.

          <h3>Personal Life</h3>
          <p>
            Sunal kept himself and his family away from the media and rarely
            appeared in public. People who knew him have commented on how
            serious he was in his real life, in contrast to the funny characters
            he played in his movies. Whilst he was at the top of his career, he
            decided to finish university, which he had dropped out of in his
            early career. Despite his fame, he attended the university like a
            regular student and stated that "that was the way he liked it to
            be".
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sunal's dreams of higher-education were disrupted in 1980, during
            the period of military takeover. His attempts to earn a degree
            finally paid off in 1995, when he earned his bachelor’s degree in
            Radio Television and Cinema Studies from Marmara University. He then
            decided to pursue a master’s degree (the topic of this thesis being
            himself), which he earned in 1998, also from Marmara University.
            This incident was covered by the media with headlines like "İnek
            Şaban Master Yaptı" (Şaban the Geek got a master's degree) while his
            'classmates' from Hababam Sinifi made comments like "Profesorluk
            Bekliyoruz" ("We expect full professorship"). At his graduation
            ceremony, he made a speech joking that his path of first working and
            then attending university later in life was better as it allowed him
            to gain real life experience first.

          <h3>Death</h3>
          <p>
            Kemal Sunal died on July 3, 2000, as a result of a sudden heart
            attack aboard a flight to Trabzon just before take-off. He was
            reported to be afraid of flying. His death caused mourning that
            swept the entire nation and dominated news coverage for many days.
            He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul.

          <p>
            Kemal Sunal and his wife Gül Sunal (born 1957) had two children, Ali
            Sunal (born 1977) and Ezo Sunal (born 1984).

            I am not a balloon. There are those who come out like that and they
            have to be on TV every day to stay afloat. But I don't need such a
